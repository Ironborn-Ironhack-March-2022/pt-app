# My Personal Trainer by Ruben Poelen, Louise Gabrielle & Harry Marchbank

# -- Description 
    This was the project was created to cap the end of the second module of Ironhack's web development bootcamp. As a team we decided to create an app for personal trainers and their clients. We included functionality so that personal trainers could create exercises and workouts and send them to their clients who could then complete them at will.
